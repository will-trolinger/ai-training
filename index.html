            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- ============================================
             SECTION 2: WHAT IS AI?
             ============================================ -->
        <section id="what-is-ai" class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-header collapsible-header" data-target="what-is-ai-content">What is AI?</h2>
            <div class="collapsible-content" id="what-is-ai-content">

            <h3>The "Zip File of the Internet" Mental Model</h3>
            <p>Think of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a <strong>"zip file" of the internet</strong>. During training, the AI reads essentially all of the internet and compresses that knowledge into its neural network. When you ask a question, it's recalling information from this compressed knowledge base.</p>
            <p>This compression happens through a process called <strong>pre-training</strong>, where the model learns patterns from massive amounts of text. Then, through <strong>post-training</strong>, human labelers fine-tune it to respond helpfully as an assistant.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Tokens: How AI Reads Text</h3>
            <p>AI doesn't read words the way we do. It breaks text into <strong>tokens</strong> - small chunks that can be parts of words, whole words, or punctuation. A short sentence might be 15 tokens, while a paragraph could be 50-100 tokens.</p>
            <p>Why does this matter?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer conversations use more tokens, which can slow things down</li>
                <li>There's a limit to how many tokens AI can process at once (the "context window")</li>
                <li>Understanding tokens helps you write more efficient prompts</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Try it yourself:</strong> <a href="https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tik Tokenizer</a> lets you see exactly how your text gets broken into tokens.</p>

            <h3>The Context Window: AI's Working Memory</h3>
            <p>When you chat with AI, you're building a <strong>one-dimensional token sequence</strong> together. Your messages + AI's responses = the conversation history. This is called the <strong>context window</strong> - it's the AI's working memory for your conversation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI remembers everything in your current chat</li>
                <li>When you start a <strong>new chat</strong>, you wipe that memory and start fresh</li>
                <li>Starting fresh is often good - it keeps the AI focused on your current task</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start a new chat when switching to a completely different topic. This prevents the AI from being distracted by old content and can improve response quality.</p>

            <h3>Probabilistic Recall: Why AI Can Be Wrong</h3>
            <p>AI doesn't "remember" facts like a database looks up records. It <strong>probabilistically reconstructs</strong> information based on patterns. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can occasionally get facts wrong (called "hallucinations")</li>
                <li>It may sound confident even when incorrect</li>
                <li>Common information is more reliable than obscure details</li>
                <li><strong>Always verify important information</strong> against primary sources</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Two Critical Limitations</h3>
            <p>By default, when you talk to an AI, you're talking to a <strong>self-contained entity</strong>. There's no calculator, no internet connection, no access to your files - just a neural network predicting helpful responses based on its compressed knowledge. This creates two important limitations:</p>

            <div style="background-color: #FEF3C7; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #F59E0B;">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #92400E;">1. Knowledge Cutoff Dates</h4>
                <p>AI models are trained at a specific point in time. They don't automatically know about:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>Recent news or events</li>
                    <li>New company policies or job postings</li>
                    <li>Updated salary information</li>
                    <li>Current market conditions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div style="background-color: #FEF3C7; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #F59E0B;">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #92400E;">2. Niche Information Gaps</h4>
                <p>AI excels at common knowledge but struggles with specialized, local information:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>Specific company cultures and hiring practices</li>
                    <li>Local job market conditions</li>
                    <li>Regional employer preferences</li>
                    <li>Your specific school's policies</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>The good news?</strong> These limitations have solutions. Modern AI tools come equipped with <strong>additional capabilities</strong> that extend what they can do far beyond their base training...</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- ============================================
             SECTION 3: TOOLS AI CAN USE
             ============================================ -->
        <section id="tools" class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-header collapsible-header" data-target="tools-content">Tools AI Can Use</h2>
            <div class="collapsible-content" id="tools-content">
            <p>Modern AI isn't limited to just its training knowledge. It can use <strong>external tools</strong> to search the web, run calculations, analyze files, and more. Understanding these tools helps you get much better results.</p>

            <!-- Web Search -->
            <h3>Internet Search</h3>
            <p>Remember the knowledge cutoff problem? <strong>Web search</strong> solves this by letting AI access current information from the internet in real-time.</p>

            <div style="background-color: #F0FDF4; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-left: 4px solid var(--hf-green);">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">How It Works</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>You ask a question that needs current information</li>
                    <li>The AI emits a special "search the internet" signal</li>
                    <li>It searches the web and loads relevant pages into its context</li>
                    <li>It synthesizes an answer from those fresh sources</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p><strong>When to use search:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"When are the registration deadlines for [college]?"</li>
                <li>"What's the current average salary for medical assistants in Arkansas?"</li>
                <li>"What companies are hiring in [city] right now?"</li>
                <li>Any question where the answer might have changed recently</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tools with search:</strong></p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Tool</th>
                        <th>Search Capability</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Perplexity</strong></td>
                        <td>Built specifically for search - always searches and cites sources</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>ChatGPT</strong></td>
                        <td>Has web search (automatic or manual toggle)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Gemini</strong></td>
                        <td>Integrated with Google search</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Claude</strong></td>
                        <td>Web search available (added in 2025)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you know you need current information, explicitly ask for a search or use Perplexity, rather than hoping the model auto-detects the need.</p>

            <!-- Deep Research -->
            <h3>Deep Research Mode</h3>
            <p>For complex questions, some AI tools offer <strong>Deep Research</strong> - a combination of internet search and extended thinking that runs for 5-15+ minutes. The AI:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issues <strong>many internet searches</strong> across different angles</li>
                <li>Reads through papers, articles, and documents</li>
                <li>Thinks deeply about the information</li>
                <li>Produces a <strong>comprehensive report with citations</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Great for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Industry analysis for career exploration</li>
                <li>Deep company research (culture, growth, opportunities)</li>
                <li>Comparing programs, certifications, or schools</li>
                <li>Understanding emerging career fields</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #FEF3C7; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Important caveat:</strong> Even Deep Research can miss things or make mistakes. Treat the output as a <strong>well-researched first draft</strong>, not ground truth. Always follow up on citations for critical decisions.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Code/Python Interpreter -->
            <h3>Code Execution (Python Interpreter)</h3>
            <p>LLMs can recognize problems they can't solve "in their head" and write programs to calculate the answer instead.</p>

            <p><strong>Simple math</strong> (30 x 9): The model calculates in its head - works fine.</p>
            <p><strong>Complex calculations</strong> (large numbers, statistics): The model writes Python code, runs it, and returns the accurate result.</p>

            <p><strong>What this enables:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data analysis</strong> - Upload a spreadsheet, ask for insights</li>
                <li><strong>Creating charts and graphs</strong> - Visualize trends</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate calculations</strong> - No estimation errors</li>
                <li><strong>Processing files</strong> - Extract and transform data</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #FEF3C7; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Warning:</strong> Not all AI tools have code execution. If a model doesn't have calculator access, it will still try to answer math questions and may give plausible-looking but <strong>incorrect</strong> results. Always verify numerical calculations for important work.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- File Uploads -->
            <h3>File Uploads</h3>
            <p>You can upload documents directly to AI tools and ask questions about them. The content gets converted to tokens and loaded into the context window.</p>

            <p><strong>Supported file types:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PDFs</strong> - Reports, articles, handouts, research papers</li>
                <li><strong>Word documents</strong> - Drafts, policies, lesson plans</li>
                <li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Data for analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Images</strong> - Screenshots, diagrams, photos of text</li>
                <li><strong>Code files</strong> - For technical users</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Practical uses for advisors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload a confusing policy document: "Summarize the key points"</li>
                <li>Share a student's resume draft: "What improvements would you suggest?"</li>
                <li>Upload a job posting: "What skills should a student highlight for this role?"</li>
                <li>Share a research paper: "Explain the main findings in simple terms"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Two-step best practice:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, ask the model to transcribe/extract the key information</li>
                <li>Verify the extraction is correct</li>
                <li>Then ask your analytical questions</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This ensures the model actually "saw" the content correctly before you trust its analysis.</p>

             ============================================ -->
        <section id="modalities" class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-header collapsible-header" data-target="modalities-content">Modalities: Different Ways to Interact with AI</h2>
            <div class="collapsible-content" id="modalities-content">
            <p>AI isn't limited to text anymore. Modern LLMs can work with <strong>multiple modalities</strong> - different types of input and output including text, voice, and images.</p>

            <!-- Text -->
            <h3>Text (The Default)</h3>
            <p>Text is the foundation of AI interaction. You type a message, the AI responds with text. This is what most people think of when they imagine using ChatGPT or similar tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Most tasks - writing, planning, brainstorming, explaining, analyzing.</p>

            <!-- Voice Input/Output -->
            <h3>Voice: Speech Input and Output</h3>

            <h4>Speech-to-Text Input</h4>
            <p>Instead of typing, you can speak your questions and the AI transcribes them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On mobile:</strong> Tap the microphone icon, speak your query</li>
                <li><strong>On desktop:</strong> Some tools have built-in voice; others work with system apps like SuperWhisper or Whisper Flow</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Voice input is much faster for many people. Some power users report 50-80% of their queries are voice rather than typed.</p>

            <h4>Text-to-Speech Output</h4>
            <p>Most AI apps have a "Read Aloud" feature to speak responses back to you. Useful for accessibility or when you want to listen while doing something else.</p>

            <h4>Advanced Voice Mode (Real Conversations)</h4>
            <p>Tools like ChatGPT have <strong>Advanced Voice Mode</strong> that handles audio natively - not just speech-to-text-to-speech, but actual audio processing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time conversation with very low latency</li>
                <li>Natural back-and-forth like talking to a person</li>
                <li>Can express emotion and engagement</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #F0FDF4; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-left: 4px solid var(--hf-green);">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Student Use Case: Mock Interview Practice</h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This is perfect for students who need interview practice. They can:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>Practice phone-style interviews on their own time</li>
                    <li>Get unlimited repetitions without scheduling hassles</li>
                    <li>Practice at home where they have phone access</li>
                    <li>Receive feedback after the conversation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Image Input -->
            <h3>Image Input: Seeing and Analyzing</h3>
            <p>AI can "see" images you upload - photos, screenshots, diagrams, documents. The image gets converted into tokens (through a process of breaking it into patches) and the AI can analyze what it sees.</p>

            <p><strong>Practical examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nutrition labels or documents:</strong> Upload a photo, get a breakdown of contents</li>
                <li><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Share what's on your screen, ask questions about it</li>
                <li><strong>Math from papers:</strong> Screenshot an equation, get it explained or solved</li>
                <li><strong>Handwritten notes:</strong> Upload a photo, get it transcribed</li>
                <li><strong>Confusing memes:</strong> Upload an image, get the joke explained</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>For advisors:</strong> Take a photo of a flyer, event schedule, or document and ask "What are the key details here?" or "Create a summary I can share with students."</p>

            <!-- Image Output -->
            <h3>Image Output: Generation</h3>
            <p>AI can also <strong>create</strong> images based on your descriptions. ChatGPT has native image generation built in.</p>

            <p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating simple graphics or icons</li>
                <li>Thumbnails for presentations</li>
                <li>Visual aids for lessons</li>
                <li>Creative content</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>For most visual work,</strong> Canva is still the better choice - it's designed for creating polished materials. But AI image generation is useful for quick visuals or when you need something specific that doesn't exist in templates.</p>

            <!-- Video -->
            <h3>Video Input: Point and Talk</h3>
            <p>On mobile, ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode can use your camera in real-time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Point your camera at something</li>
                <li>Ask questions about what you're showing</li>
                <li>Get responses while the camera is active</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is newer and still evolving, but it opens interesting possibilities for real-time assistance.</p>

                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> An advisor needed to plan a career fair with 40 businesses. She admits she "hates event planning" and isn't detail-oriented.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> She asked ChatGPT to create a complete event timeline. The AI generated:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setup windows and vendor arrival times</li>
                    <li>Junior and senior class walkthrough schedules</li>
                    <li>Lunch periods and breakdown logistics</li>
                    <li>Building exit procedures</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> "This now gave me the simplest path forward. I just needed to tweak it to our bell schedule."</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Why it works:</strong> AI handles the tedious details so you can focus on what matters most.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">2. Outreach Emails and Communication</h3>
                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Reaching out to businesses, explaining Rooted, and inviting speakers takes significant mental energy and time.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Give AI a few sentences about what you want to say, and ask it to write a professional email.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn 2-3 bullet points into a complete, professional message</li>
                    <li>Rephrase, shorten, or formalize existing drafts</li>
                    <li>Create reusable templates for recurring outreach</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> "This takes the brain suck power out of it. Give it three sentences and tell it to beef it up."</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Removes the friction of "what do I say?" so you actually send those important emails.</p>

                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> An advisor found a local community website and asked AI to create a scavenger hunt from it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>15 search-and-find questions generated instantly</li>
                    <li>Complete answer key included</li>
                    <li>Options for multiple choice or open-ended formats</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> "A creative project that would literally take hours to game plan... boom, it's done."</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Your local knowledge + AI's speed = activities that actually connect to your community.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">4. Mock Interview Practice (Voice Mode)</h3>
                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Students need interview practice, but advisors lack time for one-on-one sessions and business partners can't always volunteer.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> AI tools with voice mode can simulate phone interviews. Students can practice anytime.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode supports real conversations</li>
                    <li>Students practice without scheduling constraints</li>
                    <li>Unlimited practice opportunities</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> "This cuts out the miscommunication and timing it takes to find someone willing to volunteer an hour."</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Students get the practice they need, when they need it.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-content" id="best-practices-content">

            <h3>Be Specific</h3>
            <p>The more context you give, the better the output. Instead of "write an email," try "write a professional email to invite a local bank manager to speak at our career day on March 15th."</p>

            <h3>Iterate and Refine</h3>
            <p>Your first result doesn't have to be perfect. Ask AI to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Make this shorter"</li>
                <li>"Make it more formal"</li>
                <li>"Add more detail about [topic]"</li>
                <li>"Rewrite this for a [different audience]"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Start Fresh for New Topics</h3>
            <p>When you switch to a completely different task, start a new chat. This helps the AI stay focused on your current need.</p>

            <h3>The "LLM Council" Approach</h3>
            <p>For important decisions, consider asking <strong>multiple AI tools</strong> the same question and comparing responses. When they agree, you can be more confident. When they disagree, you know to dig deeper.</p>

            <h3>Always Review the Output</h3>
            <p>AI is a powerful assistant, but you're the expert on your students and community. Review everything before using it, and make adjustments as needed.</p>

            <h3>What AI is Good At</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drafting emails and communications</li>
                <li>Creating timelines and schedules</li>
                <li>Generating activity ideas</li>
                <li>Explaining complex topics simply</li>
                <li>Brainstorming and organizing thoughts</li>
                <li>Research with search-enabled tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What AI is Not Good At</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowing your specific students and community</li>
                <li>Providing guaranteed accurate facts (always verify)</li>
                <li>Understanding recent local events (without search)</li>
