## Message 1 – User

I need you to find all the AI tools that offer educational discounts. This could be Meta, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc. This would be for either teachers or students. I would like links to the softwares with discounts, what the normal price is and what the discounted price is.  

---

## Message 2 – Assistant

Here’s the honest answer: there’s no way to literally list *all* AI tools with education discounts — there are hundreds and new promos come and go constantly. What I *can* do is give you a solid, up‑to‑date map of the **major AI tools that actually have clear, documented student/teacher pricing as of late 2025**, plus notes on OpenAI / Anthropic / Meta / Google specifically.

I’ll focus on:

- Big general AI assistants  
- AI tools heavily used in education (design, tutoring, writing)  
- Coding / developer AI  
- Then a reality check on Meta, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google

Prices are in USD unless stated otherwise and can vary a bit by region / tax.

---

### 1. General AI assistants with explicit education pricing

#### Perplexity – Education Pro

What it is: AI search + research assistant (great for study / literature review).

- Normal price: Perplexity Pro: **$20/month** or $200/year.  
- Edu price: **Education Pro: $4.99/month** after a **free first month** for first‑time subscribers.  
- Effective discount: ~**75% off** the standard $20/month Pro price, plus 1 month free.  
- Eligibility: Verified **university‑level student or faculty** via SheerID.  
- What you get: Everything in Pro (advanced models, image generation, file analysis) **plus** Study Mode, extra citations, extended Research/Academic modes.  
- Link: Perplexity plans → “Which Perplexity subscription plan is right for you?”

---

#### Khan Academy – Khanmigo

What it is: GPT‑powered tutor and teacher assistant built into Khan Academy.

- Normal price (individual): **$4/month** or **$44/year** for learners/parents.  
- Teacher price: **$0 – 100% free for teachers** (Teacher Tools subscription).  
- Effective discount: Teachers pay nothing vs the $4/mo learner price.  
- Eligibility: Teachers in the US and selected global locales (K‑12 focus).  
- Link: Khanmigo pricing page.

---

#### Google – One AI Premium (Gemini Advanced + NotebookLM) – US student plan

What it is: Consumer plan that includes Gemini Advanced models, AI in Gmail/Docs, 2 TB storage **and** the upgraded NotebookLM.  

- Normal price: **$19.99/month** (Google One AI Premium).  
- Student price: **$9.99/month for eligible US students** (roughly 50% off for 12 months).  
- Effective discount: **50% off** the normal monthly price.  
- Eligibility: “Eligible US students” (verification required through Google’s flow / school domain).  
- Link: Google One AI / AI Premium plans page.

For institutions, there is also **Gemini for Google Workspace – Education** (edu add‑ons like “Gemini AI Pro for Education” at lower per‑seat prices than business plans), but those are B2B contracts, not individual discounts.

---

#### Microsoft – Copilot for Education

Microsoft currently has two separate “edu” angles:

1. **Copilot Chat – free with edu licenses**

- Normal business situation: Businesses pay for Microsoft 365 + Copilot add‑on (historically around **$30/user/month**, recently trending lower in some SKUs).
- Edu price (chat): **Copilot Chat is available at no additional cost** when you sign in with a **Microsoft 365 A1, A3, or A5 education license**.
- Effective discount: Roughly equivalent to getting a **paid work‑grade AI chat for free** if your institution already licenses A‑series edu SKUs.
- Eligibility: Faculty, staff, and higher‑ed students (13+) with A1/A3/A5 school accounts.
- Link: Microsoft – “Get started with Copilot in Education”.

2. **Microsoft 365 Copilot – Education SKU**

- Normal enterprise price: Microsoft 365 Copilot for business is around **$21–$30/user/month** depending on plan & recent price cuts.
- Edu price: New Microsoft 365 Copilot academic license at **$18/user/month** for education (cheaper than the general business price).
- Effective discount: Several dollars cheaper per seat than general business pricing, plus extra edu governance defaults.
- Link: Microsoft education/Copilot blog.

---

### 2. Design / teaching tools with strong education deals

#### Canva – Canva for Education (with Magic AI tools)

What it is: Design suite with a **ton of AI features** (Magic Write, Magic Design, AI course generator, etc.).

- Normal price: **Canva Pro ~ $12.99–$15/month** for individuals in the US.  
- Edu price: **$0 – Canva for Education is 100% free** for eligible K‑12 teachers, students, schools, and districts.  
- Effective discount: Effectively a **full Pro‑level upgrade free** for edu (design + AI features like AI lesson plan generator, AI course creator, Magic Write, etc.).  
- Eligibility: K‑12 (primary/secondary) teachers, librarians, their students, and qualifying K‑12 schools/districts, worldwide.  
- Links: Canva for Education / Canva AI for teachers pages.

If you’re teaching anything with visuals, this is one of the biggest “free AI upgrades” you can get.

---

#### Notion – Free Plus plan for students & teachers (with limited AI)

What it is: Knowledge base / notes / project management with AI assistants baked in.

- Normal Plus plan: **$10 per member / month** (annual billing).  
- Edu price: **Education Plus Plan is a free Plus plan** for individual students and teachers; student orgs can get a free Plus workspace with unlimited members.  
- AI caveat: Notion changed AI pricing: **full AI features are only unlocked on Business/Enterprise**; edu Plus accounts get only a **limited AI trial (e.g. ~20 responses)**, then must upgrade like everyone else.
- Effective discount: Great discount on the *core workspace*, but **not** a recurring AI discount.
- Links: Notion for Education; Notion pricing.

So: Notion is **free as a productivity tool for edu**, but if you want heavy AI in Notion, you’re basically paying business prices.

---

#### Adobe – Creative Cloud Pro student/teacher plans (with Firefly AI)

What it is: Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, etc., now with integrated generative AI (Firefly, text‑to‑image, generative fill, etc.).

- Normal price (All Apps / Pro): Around **$69.99/month** for individuals after the June 2025 rebrand to “Creative Cloud Pro” in North America.
- Edu price: Student/teacher plans are typically **heavily discounted** (often **50–70% off** vs full price); recent back‑to‑school deals cut Pro from $70 → ~$42/month for first year, with additional student offers layered on top.
- Effective discount: Ballpark: **40–70% off**, depending on promo and region.
- Link: Adobe “Students & Teachers” Creative Cloud page (region‑specific).

Because Creative Cloud includes Firefly generative AI credits, this is effectively a big AI tooling discount for design/media students.

---

### 3. AI study / writing helpers with student pricing

#### Perplexity Education Pro (recap)

Already covered; it’s probably the single best “AI for studying/research” edu deal right now.

---

#### Grammarly – Student/teacher discounts on Grammarly Pro

What it is: AI‑enabled writing assistant (grammar + style + generative AI).

- Normal price: Grammarly Pro list pricing varies by region and billing, but think **low‑teens/month on annual plans** and significantly higher on month‑to‑month.
- Edu discounts:
  - Grammarly’s edu page: students/educators can redeem a **“special offer”** for Grammarly Pro.
  - Via Student Beans there are **two active student deals**: **20% off** and **50% off a full 1‑year subscription to Grammarly Pro**.
- Effective price: As a rough feel: if annual were ~$144/year, 20% off → ~$115/year; 50% off promo → ~$72/year. Exact numbers depend on whatever base price Grammarly is currently quoting in your region.
- Links: Grammarly for Education; Student Beans – Grammarly page.

---

#### Jasper – 20% off for students & teachers

What it is: AI marketing / content creation platform (copywriting, social, blogs, etc.).

- Normal price: Depends on plan (Creator, Pro, Business); commonly **dozens of dollars per month** per seat for Creator/Pro.
- Edu discount: Jasper’s help center explicitly offers **20% off if you’re a student or teacher** (discounts don’t stack with other promos).
- Effective discount: Straight **20% reduction** on whatever plan you buy.
- Link: Jasper Discounts and Promos.

---

#### Other AI writing/study tools with student discounts (via aggregators)

Examples currently visible on Student Beans / similar:

- **QuillBot** – “25% on annual subscriptions” (AI paraphrasing / writing).  
- **Paperpal** – “30% Student Discount on the Paperpal AI Writing Tool”.  

These are **via third‑party student verification platforms**, not “education editions” of the tools.

---

### 4. Coding & developer‑oriented AI

#### GitHub Copilot – Free for students & teachers

- Normal price: historically **$10/month for individuals** and **$19/user/month** for Copilot Business.
- Edu price: verified **students and teachers get Copilot free** via GitHub Education (Student Developer Pack).
- Effective discount: ~**100% off** the $10/month individual price.
- Link: GitHub Education / Student Developer Pack → Copilot.

If you’re in data science or CS, this is one of the highest‑value AI discounts you can grab.

---

### 5. “Education‑native” AI platforms

#### Canva for Education + Khanmigo (recap)

For classroom use, as of late 2025 the “no‑brainer” stack is:

- **Canva Education:** 100% free, Canva‑Pro‑level features + Magic AI tools for K‑12 teachers and students.  
- **Khanmigo:** free for teachers, $4/month for learners/parents.  

These two alone cover lesson creation, worksheets, presentations, AI tutoring, and student practice.

---

### 6. What about Meta, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google specifically?

#### Meta

- **10% education discount on hardware**: Meta offers a **10% education discount on Quest headsets and Ray‑Ban smart glasses** for US university students and educators with a `.edu` email. This is **hardware**, not AI SaaS, but those devices do include Meta’s AI features.
- **Meta for Education bundle**: a bundle of Quest headsets + Meta Horizon managed solutions, focused on mixed/virtual‑reality lessons, sold as an education‑only product with bundled pricing.

If you’re strictly interested in “AI chatbot” software discounts, Meta doesn’t really have a public student/teacher price; their Meta AI assistant is just free inside their apps.

---

#### Anthropic (Claude)

- Anthropic has **“Claude for Education”**, a university‑wide plan with a “learning mode” that behaves like a tutor and institution‑level governance features.
- They **do not** publish a standard student/teacher discount for Claude Pro/Max. Pricing is negotiated via sales. Consumer plans (Free / Pro / Max) are normal prices (Pro around $20/month range, Max tiers at $100 and $200/month).

So: yes, there *is* an education offering, but **no public “Pro is $X, edu is $Y” discount** you can just click and buy as a student.

---

#### OpenAI (ChatGPT)

- **ChatGPT Plus**: list price **around $20/month** for individuals.
- **ChatGPT Pro**: **$200/month**, aimed at heavy / business‑like usage.
- **Student promo (US + Canada, Mar–May 2025):** OpenAI ran a **limited promotion** giving **two free months of ChatGPT Plus** to verified college students; that promo **ended May 31, 2025**.
- **ChatGPT Edu:** institution‑focused product for universities, pricing is negotiated; no “per student” public discount.

So as of now, **no permanent, self‑serve educational discount tier for individual ChatGPT Plus users**.

---

#### Google (beyond the student Gemini plan)

Already covered:

- **Google One AI Premium** – $19.99 normal, $9.99 for eligible US students for 12 months.
- **Gemini for Google Workspace – Education** – separate edu SKUs (AI add‑ons) with lower per‑seat pricing than business, but these are negotiated/campus licenses rather than simple “student discount” buttons.

---

### 7. This is not exhaustive – where to look for more

If you want to hunt for every last AI discount:

- Student verification platforms  
  - **Student Beans** – aggregates student deals (Grammarly, QuillBot, Paperpal, Adobe, etc.).  
  - **SheerID** – used by Perplexity and many others to verify student/faculty status.  

- Edu program hubs  
  - GitHub Education (Copilot, Replit offers historically, etc.)  
  - Google for Education, Microsoft Education, AWS Educate, Google Cloud for Education: mostly **free credit programs** rather than simple % discounts.

There are *many* smaller/vertical AI tools (note‑takers, code‑gen platforms, niche tutors) with 10–50% student discounts in Student Beans, UNiDAYS, etc.

---

### 8. Quick action plan

If you’re a **student**:

1. Grab the cheapest serious assistants first  
   - Perplexity **Education Pro ($4.99/mo)**.  
   - Google **One AI Premium student plan ($9.99/mo in US)** if you live in Docs/Gmail and want Gemini Advanced + NotebookLM.  

2. Check your school account  
   - Do you already have **Microsoft 365 A1/A3/A5**? If yes, you may get **Copilot Chat free**.  

3. Developer?  
   - Verify for **GitHub Copilot free** through GitHub Education.

4. Writing‑heavy majors  
   - Decide whether a discounted **Grammarly Pro** or **QuillBot/Paperpal** subscription is worth it vs just using Perplexity + a frontier model.

If you’re a **teacher**:

1. Immediately claim the 100% free, high‑value stuff  
   - **Canva for Education**.  
   - **Khanmigo for Teachers**.  

2. Ask IT about your institution licenses  
   - Microsoft 365 edu → **Copilot Chat** and the **$18/user/mo** path to full M365 Copilot.  
   - Check if your university is piloting **Claude for Education** or **ChatGPT Edu**.  

3. Optionally layer in Perplexity Education Pro for prep (researching content, building problem sets, etc.).

---

## Message 3 – User

Let's do these:

LLMs:

 * This would be like Perplexity, Claude, OpenAI, Google, etc. the big ones. 

Coding Tools: 

* Github Copilot like tools, big ones. 

Other tools: 
* Canva, Khanmingo like you said, etc. 


I do not want ALL of them. I want the ones that are useful. Big name companies that are sharing quality products, not just any AI slop GPT wrapper.

---

## Message 4 – Assistant

Got it — we’ll focus on **big, serious players only**, grouped exactly how you asked:

- **LLMs** (Perplexity, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Meta)  
- **Coding tools** (Copilot‑class stuff)  
- **Other tools** (Canva, Khanmigo, Figma, etc.)

For each, I’ll say:

- **Standard price**
- **Education price / deal**
- **How “real” the discount is** (individual vs institution vs “none”)

All prices in **USD / month** unless noted.

---

### 1. LLMs (Perplexity, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Meta)

#### TL;DR

- **Only one mainstream LLM with a great, global personal student plan:** **Perplexity**  
- **Google** has a **true 50% student discount** on its AI Premium plan.  
- **OpenAI & Anthropic:** no general student discount; discounts are via **institution deals** only.  
- **Microsoft Copilot:** discounted **academic license** for institutions.  
- **Meta:** models and assistants mostly **free / open**, so no “discount” per se.

---

#### 1.1 Perplexity – Education Pro

What it is: AI search + research assistant.

- Standard price: Perplexity Pro: **$20/mo** or $200/yr.  
- Education deal (individual):  
  - Education Pro: 1st month free, then **$4.99/mo**.  
  - Requires university student/faculty verification via SheerID.  
  - ~75% off the standard Pro price.
- Institutional deal: Enterprise Pro seats normally start around **$40/user/mo**, with 50% off for educational institutions and nonprofits.
- Link: Perplexity subscription plans → Education Pro section.

This is currently the cleanest, global, self‑serve **student/faculty plan** for a general‑purpose LLM.

---

#### 1.2 Google – Gemini via Google One AI Premium & AI Pro for Education

**Personal (Google One AI Premium):**

- Standard price: **$19.99/mo** for Google One AI Premium (Gemini Advanced + NotebookLM Plus + 2 TB cloud storage).  
- Student deal: **$9.99/mo** (50% off) for eligible US students (18+), for 12 months.  
- Good if: you live in **Docs/Gmail/Drive** and want Gemini deeply integrated.

**Institutional (Google AI Pro for Education):**

- Workspace add‑on for schools: around **$24/user/mo (flex)** or **$20/user/mo (annual)** as a generative AI add‑on for Workspace for Education.  
- Sold to institutions, not individuals.

---

#### 1.3 OpenAI – ChatGPT (Plus / Pro / Edu)

**Consumer:**

- ChatGPT Plus: **$20/mo**.  
- ChatGPT Pro: **$200/mo**.

**Education reality:**

- There is **no standing public student/teacher discount** for Plus or Pro.  
- **ChatGPT Edu** is a separate product for universities (bulk licensing, enterprise features, GPT‑4‑class models). Pricing is **“contact sales”** and handled campus‑by‑campus.  
- Some universities give their students “ChatGPT Edu” or Plus‑like access as part of tuition, but that’s your school buying seats, not a global student discount.

Bottom line: as an individual student/teacher with your own credit card, you pay full Plus/Pro unless your institution has a deal.

---

#### 1.4 Anthropic – Claude

- Claude Pro: **~$20/mo** (or $200/yr).  
- Claude Max: **$100–200/mo** tiers for much heavier usage.

Education side:

- **Claude for Education** exists as an institutional offering (campus‑wide learning mode, governance, etc.), but prices are negotiated.  
- Some schools have special promos (e.g., $1/mo Claude Pro for their students), but those are **campus‑specific**, not a general student program.

So again: fantastic product, but **no global individual student discount**.

---

#### 1.5 Microsoft – Copilot (chat + in‑product)

Two relevant things:

1. **Copilot Chat “free” with education licenses**

   - If your institution already has **Microsoft 365 A1/A3/A5**, Copilot Chat is often available at **no extra cost** when you log in with that school account (depending on rollout).  
   - That effectively gives you a very capable LLM assistant “for free” as a side effect of your school’s Microsoft licensing.

2. **Microsoft 365 Copilot academic license**

   - Business price for M365 Copilot add‑on is around **$30/user/mo**.  
   - The new **academic license** is **$18/user/mo** for staff and students (13+).  
   - This is paid by institutions rather than individuals in most cases.

---

#### 1.6 Meta – Llama / Meta AI

- **Meta AI** chatbot in Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp: **free**, no paid tier.  
- **Llama 3** family: released under the Llama Community License, which allows broad free use for research/education (subject to license details).

Meta’s angle is mostly “free/open,” not a classic subscription with a student discount.

---

### 2. Coding tools (Copilot‑class) with education angles

#### TL;DR

- The only *big‑name* AI coding assistant with a **strong, global, official education deal** is **GitHub Copilot**.  
- JetBrains AI Assistant, Sourcegraph Cody, Replit’s AI, etc. are solid tools but **don’t have special student pricing** beyond free tiers that everyone gets.

---

#### 2.1 GitHub Copilot

What it is: AI code assistant for VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, etc.

- Standard price:  
  - Copilot Pro: **$10/mo** or **$100/yr** for individuals.  
- Education deal:  
  - **100% free** for:
    - Verified **students**  
    - **Teachers/educators**  
    - Some OSS maintainers  
  - Access via **GitHub Education / Student Developer Pack**.
- Effective discount: You’re skipping the $10/mo entirely — huge win if you write code regularly.

If you’re in anything like CS, data science, or software engineering, this should be one of the first things you turn on.

---

#### 2.2 JetBrains AI Assistant

- Good tool: deep IDE integration, context‑aware chat, refactor suggestions, etc.  
- Licensing:
  - JetBrains AI has **AI Free, AI Pro, AI Ultimate, AI Enterprise** tiers.  
  - AI Pro is bundled into **paid All Products Pack / dotUltimate** subscriptions.
- Education angle:
  - JetBrains gives students the **Student Pack** (full IDEs) free, but AI Assistant **is not fully free** under that license. You get the same AI Free tier as everyone else; for full AI Pro you need a paid AI subscription.

Conclusion: high‑quality, but **no special AI student discount**.

---

#### 2.3 Sourcegraph Cody

- What it is: AI coding assistant that’s very strong on large‑codebase search and reasoning.  
- Pricing:
  - Has a **“Free forever”** plan for individuals (rate‑limited but usable).  
  - Pro and Enterprise tiers exist above that.  
- Education:
  - No specific student/teacher pricing — just the same free tier as everyone else.

If you want a Copilot alternative and don’t care about formal edu pricing, Cody’s free tier is a contender. But in terms of **explicit education perks**, Copilot still dominates.

---

### 3. “Other tools” – Canva, Khanmigo, Figma, etc. (big names only)

These are the non‑slop, big‑name tools that either:

- Have **real student/teacher pricing**, or  
- Are outright **free for education**.

---

#### 3.1 Canva for Education

- Standard: Canva Pro ≈ **$12.99/mo** (region‑dependent).  
- Education: **Canva for Education = 100% free** for verified K‑12 teachers and their students.  
- Includes AI:
  - Magic Write (AI text generation).  
  - Magic Design (auto‑layouts, slides).  
  - AI lesson/worksheet/course generators, etc.

For K‑12 or any visual teaching, this is an extremely high‑value freebie.

---

#### 3.2 Khan Academy – Khanmigo

- Standard: For learners/parents: **$4/mo** or **$44/yr** in the US.  
- Education deal:
  - **Free for teachers**: Khanmigo Teacher Tools are free; classroom roll‑outs are covered by donors/partners.
- Use cases:
  - AI tutor for math, science, humanities.  
  - Lesson planning and practice generation.

Combination to notice: **Khanmigo + Canva** gives a **free AI tutor + free AI content creator** for classrooms.

---

#### 3.3 Figma for Education

- Standard: Figma professional plans are around **$12–$15/editor/mo**.  
- Education deal:
  - **Figma for Education** gives **Figma + FigJam free** to verified students and educators.
  - Many schools can get org‑level access, especially if they’re already in Microsoft / Google ecosystems.
- AI:
  - Figma now has **Figma AI** (assistive design tools, summarization, auto‑layout help, etc.).

If you’re doing UX/UI, product design, or collaborative whiteboarding, this is a staple.

---

#### 3.4 Notion – Education Plus

- Standard: Notion **Plus** ≈ **$10/user/mo** on annual billing.  
- Edu deal:
  - **Education Plus plan**: free Plus workspace for a single student/teacher, and free Plus for student orgs.  
- AI caveat:
  - Full Notion AI usage is mainly on Business/Enterprise; edu workspaces get limited AI and then you need a paid AI upgrade.

So: strong workspace discount, but AI is only semi‑discounted.

---

#### 3.5 Grammarly – student & faculty discount

- Standard: Grammarly Premium ~**$12/mo**.  
- Edu:
  - Official SheerID program offers **50% off** for:
    - Students  
    - K‑12 faculty  
    - University faculty  
  - So ballpark ~**$6/mo** on the discounted plan.
- Includes AI:
  - GrammarlyGO and other generative features for rewriting, tone, ideas, etc.

This is worthwhile if you’re constantly writing essays, reports, or emails and want a more “polished writing” helper than a general LLM.

---

#### 3.6 Otter.ai – lecture / meeting notes

- Standard Otter Pro:
  - Monthly: **$16.99/mo**.  
  - Annual: ~**$10/mo** (approx $120/yr).  
- Edu:
  - **20% off** for students and teachers:
    - Monthly → **$13.59/mo**.  
    - Annual → about **$6.67/mo** ($79.99/yr).
- Use:
  - Record lectures, auto‑summaries, searchable transcripts, basic AI notes.

Good if you’re in a lecture‑heavy environment or constantly in meetings.

---

#### 3.7 Adobe Creative Cloud – Students & Teachers

- Standard: Creative Cloud Pro “All Apps” plan around **$69.99/mo**.  
- Edu:
  - Students & teachers: **$39.99/mo** (≈ 43% off), often deeper first‑year promotions.  
- Includes AI:
  - Firefly generative image tools.  
  - Generative fill in Photoshop.  
  - AI features in Premiere, Audition, etc.

This is heavy‑duty but essential for design, video, and creative programs.

---

### 4. What’s actually worth it, given you only want big, non‑slop tools?

If we filter to **big, reputable products** and ask “where is the education discount actually meaningful?”:

#### LLMs (personal):

- **Perplexity Education Pro** – $4.99/mo instead of $20; sharp, research‑oriented.  
- **Google One AI Premium student plan** – $9.99/mo instead of $19.99; best if you live in the Google stack.

Everyone else (ChatGPT, Claude) is either **full price** for individuals or **only discounted via your institution**.

---

#### Coding:

- **GitHub Copilot Pro – free for students and educators.**  
  This is by far the standout. If you’re serious about coding and qualify, turn this on before paying for any other coding AI.

---

#### Other (teaching, design, writing):

For **students**:

- **Figma for Education** – free.  
- **Grammarly with 50% off** – if you’re writing a ton.  
- **Otter with 20% off** – if you rely on recorded lectures.  
- Optional: **Adobe Creative Cloud student plan** if you’re in creative/visual disciplines.

For **teachers (especially K‑12)**:

- **Canva for Education – free.**  
- **Khanmigo for Teachers – free.**  
- Use whatever your school already licenses:
  - Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat (often “free” with A1/A3/A5).  
  - Possibly institution‑wide ChatGPT Edu or Claude for Education.
