# AI Training Planning for Heartland Forward Rooted Advisors

**Date/Time:** November 24, 2025 12:34 PM CST

## Background and Purpose
This meeting focused on designing an introductory AI training specifically for the advisors in Heartland Forward’s **Rooted** program. The Rooted program supports high school students by strengthening career readiness, building relationships with local employers, and helping students navigate postsecondary pathways. Advisors carry a diverse workload—event planning, outreach, creating lessons and activities, and supporting students individually—which makes AI an opportunity to reduce administrative burden and amplify their impact.

Will and Ali met to determine **what this training should cover**, **how hands-on it needs to be**, and **which examples would resonate most** with advisors who vary widely in comfort with technology. Many advisors either use AI only lightly or have not yet tried it at all. The training must meet advisors where they are: simple, approachable, practical, and directly tied to their daily responsibilities.

## Summary of What the Training Needs to Accomplish
The goal is a **40-minute Zoom session** that introduces AI in a way that feels realistic and immediately useful—not overwhelming or overly technical. The training should:
- Explain what AI tools are and where their information comes from.
- Show advisors how to create an account on a free tool and follow along live.
- Demonstrate 2–3 high-impact advisor use cases.
- Highlight what is free for advisors and students (e.g., ChatGPT free for teachers).
- Provide simple prompts they can reuse.
- Use polls to understand who has used which tools before.
- Reduce fear and increase confidence.

While the Stimuli-created tool-to-task table is several years old, revisiting it can help anchor advisors in where AI can naturally fit into their responsibilities.

## Advisor Context to Keep in Mind
Rooted advisors:
- Have mixed familiarity with technology—some are confident, many are hesitant.
- Are overworked, handling everything from community engagement to event logistics.
- Often work in schools where students have **limited device access**, relying on Chromebook carts or shared devices.
- Need tools that simplify tasks, not complicate them.
- Benefit from examples that support efficiency, communication, and creativity—not just instruction.

The training must make AI feel like a *supportive tool* rather than something they are being forced into.

## Expanded Use Cases to Include in the Training

### 1. Event Planning Timelines (High-Impact Example)
An advisor used ChatGPT to create a full event timeline for a career fair with 40 businesses. AI generated:
- Setup windows
- Vendor arrival times
- Junior & senior walkthrough schedules
- Lunch periods
- Breakdown logistics

The advisor said she hates event planning and isn’t detail-oriented—yet with AI, she simply adjusted the timeline to match her school’s bell schedule.

This example shows how AI eliminates a major administrative headache.

### 2. Outreach Emails and Communication Support
Many advisors dislike outreach—explaining Rooted, inviting speakers, or contacting businesses. AI makes this easier by:
- Turning 2–3 sentences into a professional email
- Helping advisors rephrase, shorten, or formalize messages
- Creating templates for recurring outreach tasks

This directly supports Rooted’s goal of building local partnerships.

### 3. Website-Based Scavenger Hunts and Quick Lesson Plans
An advisor used AI to generate a scavenger hunt from a community-based website. AI produced:
- 15 search-and-find questions
- The answer key
- Multiple choice or open-ended formats

This turns a multi-hour prep task into minutes, and it keeps activities connected to local contexts.

### 4. Mock Interview Practice Using Voice Mode
Students can practice phone-style interviews with AI tools that support voice conversations. This solves several issues:
- Advisors lack time for one-on-one mock interviews.
- Business partners cannot always volunteer.
- Students need repeated practice.

AI reduces miscommunication, scheduling burdens, and preparation gaps.

## Tools and Access Considerations
Before the training, Will needs to finalize a list of **free tools advisors and students can reliably use**. There is still some uncertainty about which models offer free plans and in what conditions.

Limitations to consider:
- Students’ phones are locked up during the day.
- Chromebook access varies by school.

Tools highlighted for the session:
- **ChatGPT** – now free for teachers.
- **Gemini** – often free for students, though teacher access is unclear.
- **Canva** – increasingly offers strong AI features for creating visuals, worksheets, and presentations.

## Training Action Plan

### Before the Session
1. Compile a short list of free, accessible AI tools.
2. Prepare live demo prompts for:
   - Event planning timeline
   - Outreach email
   - Website scavenger hunt
3. Recreate or clean up the Stimuli tool-to-task table.
4. Build 2–3 Zoom polls.
5. Prepare a one-page resource guide.

### During the Session
1. Run polls to assess familiarity.
2. Explain what AI is and where it gets its information.
3. Have advisors log into ChatGPT (or the selected tool) live.
4. Walk through the prompts together.
5. Show how students might use AI responsibly.
6. Leave time for questions and advisor-specific ideas.

### After the Session
- Share a follow-up PDF with links, prompts, and examples.
- Offer optional office hours for advisors who want help beginning to use AI.

## Outstanding Questions
- Which exact free AI models should Rooted advisors be trained on?
- How can AI instruction be adapted for schools with very limited device access?
- Should a Heartland Forward “Rooted GPT” be created to streamline advisor tasks in the future?
- What level of advanced tooling is appropriate given advisors’ current comfort level? (PowerPoint automation is likely too advanced.)

## Closing Notes
This meeting established a clear direction: the AI training should be simple, hands-on, and immediately beneficial to advisors’ workloads. The emphasis is not on turning advisors into tech experts but on showing them how AI can remove friction from their work and open new opportunities for students. Rooted’s mission centers on preparing students for the future—and giving advisors modern, accessible tools is part of supporting that mission effectively.
