                <p>Think of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a <strong>"zip file" of the internet</strong>.
                    During training, the AI reads essentially all of the internet and compresses that knowledge into its
                    neural network. When you ask a question, it's recalling information from this compressed knowledge
                    base.</p>
                <p>This compression happens through a process called <strong>pre-training</strong>, where the model
                    learns patterns from massive amounts of text. Then, through <strong>post-training</strong>, human
                    labelers fine-tune it to respond helpfully as an assistant.</p>
                <p><strong>See what's in the training data:</strong> <a

            <div class="collapsible-content" id="prompts-content">
                <img src="../images/how-ai-works/prompting.png"
                    alt="Diagram showing internet content (documents, images, charts) being compressed into a zip file, then transformed into a neural network brain"
                    style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1.5rem auto; border-radius: 0.5rem; display: block;">
                <p>A <strong>prompt</strong> is simply what you type (or say) to the AI. It's your input - the question,
                    instruction, or request that kicks off the conversation. Everything you've learned so far - tokens,
                    context windows, modalities - all comes together in your prompt.</p>
                <p>When you send a prompt:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your text gets broken into <strong>tokens</strong></li>
                    <li>Those tokens enter the AI's <strong>context window</strong></li>
                    <li>Prompts other forms of data like <strong>images</strong> or <strong>files</strong></li>
                    <li>The AI predicts the most helpful response based on patterns from its training</li>
                    <li>Some predictions will invoke the usage of external <strong>tools</strong> or
                        <strong>plugins</strong></li>

                </ul>
                <p>The quality of AI's output depends heavily on the quality of your input. Vague prompts get vague
                    answers. Specific, well-structured prompts get useful responses. This is why <strong>"prompt
                        engineering"</strong> has become such a valuable skill.</p>
                <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> You're not searching a database or giving commands to a simple program.
                    You're having a conversation with a system that predicts helpful responses. The more context and
                    clarity you provide, the better it can help you.</p>

                <p>AI doesn't read words the way we do. It breaks text into <strong>tokens</strong> - small chunks that
                    can be parts of words, whole words, or punctuation. A short sentence might be 15 tokens, while a
                    paragraph could be 50-100 tokens.</p>
                <p>Why does this matter?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Longer conversations use more tokens, which can slow things down</li>
                    <li>There's a limit to how many tokens AI can process at once (the "context window")</li>
                    <li>Understanding tokens helps you write more efficient prompts</li>

                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #6B7280; text-align: center; margin-top: 0.5rem;"></p>
                <p>When you chat with AI, you're building a <strong>one-dimensional token sequence</strong> together.
                    Your messages + AI's responses = the conversation history. This is called the <strong>context
                        window</strong> - it's the AI's working memory for your conversation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI remembers everything in your current chat</li>
                    <li>When you start a <strong>new chat</strong>, you wipe that memory and start fresh</li>
                    <li>Starting fresh is often good - it keeps the AI focused on your current task</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The context window can be thought of like a short-term memory for the AI. It holds the recent
                    conversation so the AI can respond appropriately, but it has a limited capacity.</p>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start a new chat when switching to a completely different topic. This prevents
                    the AI from being distracted by old content and can improve response quality.</p>
                <p><strong>Visualize it:</strong> <a href="https://context-windows.damien-henry.com" target="_blank"

                <p>AI doesn't "remember" facts like a database looks up records. It <strong>probabilistically
                        reconstructs</strong> information based on patterns. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It can occasionally get facts wrong (called "hallucinations")</li>
                    <li>It may sound confident even when incorrect</li>
                    <li>Common information is more reliable than obscure details</li>
                    <li><strong>Always verify important information</strong> against primary sources</li>

                    based on patterns, not by looking them up in a dictionary. AI chatbots are just a much larger
                    version of this same concept.</p>

                <p>By default, when you talk to an AI, you're talking to a <strong>self-contained entity</strong>.
                    There's no calculator, no internet connection, no access to your files - just a neural network
                    predicting helpful responses based on its compressed knowledge. This creates two important
                    limitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge cutoff dates</strong> - AI models are trained at a specific point in time, so
                        they don't automatically know about recent news, current job postings, or today's market
                        conditions. (<a href="https://www.allmo.ai/articles/list-of-large-language-model-cut-off-dates"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See current cutoff dates</a>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Niche information gaps</strong> - AI excels at common knowledge but struggles with
                        specialized, local information like specific company cultures, regional employer preferences, or
                        your school's particular policies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The good news?</strong> These limitations have solutions. Modern AI tools come equipped with
                    <strong>additional capabilities</strong> that extend what they can do far beyond their base
                    training...</p>

                <p>AI isn't limited to text. You can interact through voice and images too - but under the hood,
                    everything still becomes tokens in that same context window.</p>
                <p><strong>Voice:</strong> Speak instead of type (tap the microphone icon). Your speech gets transcribed
                    to text, converted to tokens, and processed like any typed message. Advanced Voice Mode in ChatGPT
                    enables real-time conversations - great for mock interview practice.</p>
                <p><strong>Image Input:</strong> Upload photos and the AI "sees" them by converting the image into
                    tokens (through a process of breaking it into patches). This works for text-based images like
                    screenshots and documents, but also for identifying objects, plants, animals, landmarks, or anything
                    visual - the AI analyzes what it sees, not just reads text from it.</p>
                <p><strong>File Upload (data):</strong> Upload files for the AI to analyze and extract information from.
                    This can include documents, spreadsheets, and more, allowing for deeper interaction with your data.

                <p>Sometimes you need AI to work through a problem carefully rather than respond instantly.
                    <strong>Thinking models</strong> (also called reasoning models) take extra time to "think" before
                    answering - breaking complex problems into steps, checking their logic, and considering
                    alternatives.</p>
                <p>When you enable thinking mode:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The AI pauses before responding (seconds to minutes)</li>
                    <li>It works through the problem internally, similar to how you might talk yourself through a
                        difficult decision</li>
                    <li>You often get more accurate answers for complex tasks</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>When thinking helps most:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Math and logic problems</li>
                    <li>Multi-step planning</li>
                    <li>Analyzing tradeoffs</li>
                    <li>Tasks where getting it right matters more than getting it fast</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>When to skip it:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick factual questions</li>
                    <li>Creative brainstorming</li>
                    <li>Simple tasks where speed matters</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The tradeoff:</strong> Thinking takes longer and uses more resources. For straightforward
                    questions, standard mode is faster and works fine. Save thinking mode for when you need the AI to
                    really work through something.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-content" id="tools-content">
                <p>Remember those limitations? Modern AI solves them by connecting to external tools. When the AI
                    recognizes it needs outside help, it uses a tool, gets the result back, and continues.</p>

                <p><strong>Web Search:</strong> Bridges both the knowledge cutoff and niche information gaps by
                    searching the internet in real-time. The AI formulates queries, retrieves pages, and synthesizes
                    answers from current sources. <em>Limitation:</em> Not all websites allow AI tools to access their
                    content, so some information may be unavailable.</p>

                <p><strong>Code Execution:</strong> Some tasks require actual computation rather than language
                    prediction. When needed, the AI writes and runs code to perform calculations, analyze data, or

                <p>Deep Research isn't just another tool - it's a full research workflow. Instead of a quick web search, the AI becomes a research assistant that works for you over 5-30 minutes, running dozens of searches, reading through sources, and synthesizing findings into a comprehensive report.</p>

                <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You describe what you want to research</li>
                    <li>The AI creates a research plan and asks clarifying questions</li>
                    <li>It runs 20-50+ web searches, reading and analyzing pages</li>
                    <li>It synthesizes everything into a structured report with citations</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Best use cases for career services:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Labor market research</strong> - "Research entry-level marketing salaries in the Boston area, including trends and top employers"</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry analysis</strong> - "What skills are most in-demand for data analytics roles in 2025?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Employer research</strong> - "Compile information about [Company]'s culture, interview process, and recent news"</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource compilation</strong> - "Find scholarship opportunities for first-generation college students in STEM"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Look for "Deep Research" in the model selector (requires Plus/Pro)</li>
                    <li><strong>Gemini:</strong> "Deep Research" option in Google's Gemini</li>
                    <li><strong>Perplexity:</strong> "Pro Search" offers similar extended research</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The tradeoff:</strong> Deep Research takes real time (minutes, not seconds) and typically counts against usage limits more heavily. Use it when you need comprehensive research, not for quick questions.</p>

            <h2 class="collapsible-header" data-target="agents-content">Agents: AI That Takes Action</h2>
            <div class="collapsible-content" id="agents-content">
                <p>Everything we've covered so far - thinking, tools, modalities - comes together in <strong>agents</strong>. An agent is AI that doesn't just respond to you, but actively works toward a goal by planning steps, using tools, and adjusting based on results.</p>
                <p>With a regular chatbot, you're in the driver's seat - asking questions, giving instructions, reviewing each response. With an agent, you describe what you want accomplished, and the AI figures out how to get there.</p>
                <p><strong>What makes an agent different:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It breaks your goal into steps on its own</li>
                    <li>It decides which tools to use and when</li>
                    <li>It can try something, see the result, and adjust its approach</li>
                    <li>It works for minutes or hours, not just seconds</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Examples you might encounter:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research agents</strong> - "Find me 10 remote entry-level marketing jobs posted this week" (searches multiple sites, filters results, compiles a list)</li>
                    <li><strong>Coding agents</strong> - "Add a dark mode toggle to this website" (reads the codebase, writes code, tests it, fixes errors)</li>
                    <li><strong>Data agents</strong> - "Analyze this sales data and create a presentation" (processes files, generates charts, builds slides)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The tradeoff:</strong> Agents are powerful but less predictable. They take longer, cost more, and sometimes go down the wrong path. For simple tasks, regular chat is faster and more controlled. Use agents when the task is complex enough that you'd rather delegate the whole thing than manage each step yourself.</p>
